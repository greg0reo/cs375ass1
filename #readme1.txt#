You compile the program by typing "make" in the terminal.
Alternatively, you can type in "make program1".
Then, you run the program by writing "./program1 <filex.txt> <filey.txt> <output>"

The program uses a 2D vector to store the "memos". This vector is filled in bottom-up/

This is the fastest of the three programs we wrote.
The larger the input, the more faster this program's runtime is than the other programs. This is because iteration is faster than recursion (program3, the second fastest program, uses recursion).

I did not use any classes in this program.
